# LabVIEW_Book_Code

This folder contains collections of both demonstration VIs as well as all the VIs required to complete the book’s exercises.  Both are organized by the chapter that they are
associated with.  All demonstration VIs should be called out within the main text of the book, but feel free to play or test-run them at any time.

Depending on the exercise, VIs showing the answer(s) may also be included in the sub-folders.  Otherwise, the exercise answers will be included in the main text of the book.

For VIs that make calls to subVIs or type def controls, the necessary files will be located in either the same folder as the top-level VI, or in a sub-folder named “SubVIs” located
within the same folder.  If for some reason LabVIEW has trouble locating the subVI or type def files when the VI is opened, you should be able to manually select them.

Finally, all VIs are supplied in both LabVIEW 2020 and LabVIEW 10 formats.  VIs developed on newer versions of LabVIEW cannot be run on older versions. LabVIEW VIs are backwards
compatible, however, so select the version that is closest in time but older to the version of LabVIEW you have installed on your computer.  For instance, if you are
running LabVIEW 2022, use the 2020 version.  If you are running LabVIEW 2016, however, you must use the LabVIEW 10 version.
